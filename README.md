# A-star-3D-Pathfinding-in-Unity
This is an implementation of the a-star algorithm for three-dimensional world pathfinding Using Unity .

The A star algorithm is a pathfinding algorithm computing the shortest path between two nodes with MultiThread and points grid type for speed Computing .

You can add obstacles by clicking by right mouse button and then the grid immediately updated it .
